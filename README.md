# Convert_dcm_to_jpg

This code is a script to convert files from .dcm (DICOM) format to .jpeg format. Let's look at the main components of this code:

#--Instruction--
To run this script to convert files from DICOM to JPEG, you'll need the following:

1)Install the necessary libraries:
  pydicom: You can install it using the pip install pydicom command.
  pillow (PIL): Install it using the pip install pillow command.
  numpy: You can install it using the pip install numpy command.
  Copy the code you provided into a separate file with a .py extension.

2) Save the code file in the desired directory on your computer.
3) Open a command line (terminal) and go to the directory where the code file is located.
4) Run the script by running python <Convert_dcm_to_jpg.py>.

During the execution of the script, two dialog windows will open:
    First, a window will open in which you must select the folder with the input DICOM files.
    Then another window will open, in which you must select a folder to save the output JPEG files.
    After selecting the appropriate folders, the script will automatically start processing DICOM files and saving the output JPEG files in the specified folder.

As the script runs, you'll see a message on the command line (terminal) for each file that was successfully converted to JPEG. The path to each saved file will also be displayed.

After the script is finished, all DICOM files will be converted to JPEG and saved in the folder you specified.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully run this conversion script.
